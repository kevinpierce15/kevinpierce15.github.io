       <H1> "Breaking" My Leg </H1>

       <IMG SRC="IMG_0415.jpg" width="402.5" height="800">
       <p> One time I was skateboarding and I tripped over my skateboard and fell. I was in so much pain I thought I had broken my leg. My buddies took me to the ER and I found myself getting depressed at the thought of not being able to skateboard while my leg would have to heal. I knew this would set me way back. Fortunately enough, the doctors told me I had just sprained my ankle and I was back to skateboarding in no time!
